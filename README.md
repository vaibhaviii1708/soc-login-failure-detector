# soc-login-failure-detector
A SOC-oriented security monitoring tool designed to analyze authentication logs and identify repeated failed login attempts, simulating brute-force attack detection commonly performed by SOC analysts.
# SOC Login Failure Detection Tool

## 📌 Overview
This project is a beginner-level SOC-focused cybersecurity tool that analyzes authentication logs to detect failed login attempts, which may indicate brute-force attacks.

## 🛡️ Why this matters for SOC
Security Operations Centers (SOC) monitor authentication failures to identify:
- Brute-force attacks
- Credential stuffing
- Unauthorized access attempts

This project simulates that basic SOC detection logic.

## ⚙️ What the tool does
- Reads authentication log files
- Detects failed login attempts
- Displays suspicious activity in a simple output

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- C programming
- Basic log analysis
- Linux-style authentication logs

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Threshold-based alerts
- Timestamp analysis
- IP-based detection
- SOC-style incident reporting
